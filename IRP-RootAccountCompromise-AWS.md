## üìå Phase Overview Table

| üîÑ Phase         | üõ†Ô∏è Action                                                                                      | üë§ Primary Responsible | üß™ Tools / Commands                                          | ‚úÖ Completion Criteria                                                    |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Containment**  | Immediately attempt to sign in and reset the root password. Revoke unauthorized MFA devices.            | Security Lead            | AWS Console, `aws iam`, email recovery flow                        | Root account is recovered and access is secured.                              |
| **Containment**  | Disable active sessions and revoke all access keys linked to the root account.                         | Security Lead            | AWS CloudTrail, AWS Console, `aws iam delete-access-key`            | Root session tokens and keys are rendered unusable.                          |
| **Identification** | Review CloudTrail logs for all root activity and confirm unauthorized use.                            | Incident Responder       | AWS CloudTrail, `aws cloudtrail lookup-events`                      | Timeline of root account actions is documented.                              |
| **Eradication**   | Rotate all sensitive credentials and remove any backdoors (users, roles, policies).                    | Incident Responder       | AWS IAM, AWS Secrets Manager                                        | Credentials rotated and environment verified clean.                         |
| **Recovery**      | Reinforce least privilege by removing root access from workflows. Enable strong MFA and alerts.       | Cloud Security Architect | AWS IAM, AWS Organizations, Config Rules                            | Root usage locked down and monitored.                                       |
| **Lessons Learned** | Document root account risks and update organizational response processes.                            | Security Lead            | Security Wiki, Compliance Tracker                                  | Root compromise procedures and detection coverage are improved.             |

## üîç 1. Identification Phase

### Objective:
Validate if the root account was used maliciously and understand scope.

### AWS Commands:
```bash
# Query all events made by root user
aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=Username,AttributeValue=root

# Identify active sessions (CloudTrail + logs)
aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=ConsoleLogin
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 2. Containment Phase

### Objective:
Stop ongoing misuse of the root account.

### AWS Commands:
```bash
# Delete all root access keys (if exist)
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name root
aws iam delete-access-key --user-name root --access-key-id <key>

# Disable root MFA (only through account recovery)
# Recovery must be done via AWS support and email verification
```

---

## üßπ 3. Eradication Phase

### Objective:
Remove attacker persistence and audit for additional compromise.

### AWS Commands:
```bash
# List all IAM users and roles
aws iam list-users
aws iam list-roles

# Look for anomalies: unfamiliar users, permissions, roles
# Remove unauthorized IAM users or attached policies
aws iam delete-user --user-name <suspicious>
```

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è 4. Recovery Phase

### Objective:
Harden the root account and restore trust.

### AWS Commands:
```bash
# Ensure root account uses a strong password + MFA
# Set up CloudTrail alerting
aws sns create-topic --name RootAccountAlerts

# Enable AWS Config rule for root account usage
# Manual setup or AWS Config Console
```

---

## üìä Post-Incident Activity

### Actions:
- Conduct RCA and improve preventive controls.
- Train personnel on root account risk.
- Add root use detection to Security Hub/GuardDuty.
